# to-do-list

Created a small and simple, yet functional To-Do List App using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
The app has a clear and beautiful user interface, consisting of an input field (pressing ENTER), a button to mark the to-do as completed and a button to delete the to-do. 
The user interface also shows current date to the user and there is another button on the upper part of the interface, which serves for clearing the local storage and therefore removing all the to-dos of the user. 
However, the to-do list of the user is stored in the local storage, so that when the page refreshes, the to-dos of the user will not get deleted.

The app is also deployed on my Heroku Account and it can be accessible here: https://murati-to-do-list.herokuapp.com/
